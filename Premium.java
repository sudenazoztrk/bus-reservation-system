 * This class represents a Premium type of Bus in the system. Premium buses have a fixed seat layout
 * with three seats per row, with a premium seat fee charged for the center seat in each row.
 *
 * Properties inherited from Bus:
 *  - ID: Unique identifier for the bus.
 *  - from: Origin city of the voyage.
 *  - to: Destination city of the voyage.
 *  - rows: Number of rows in the bus.
 *  - price: Base price per seat (may be overridden to include premium fee).
 *  - revenue: Current revenue for the bus.
 *  - capacity: Total number of seats in the bus (automatically calculated as rows * 3).
 *  - seats: Boolean array representing seat availability (true for occupied, false for vacant).
 *  - refundCut: Percentage of ticket price deducted during a refund for Premium buses.
 *  - premiumFee: Additional fee charged for premium seats (center seat in each row).
